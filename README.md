## Project Name: Zentrades Task 3 & 4 Login Dashboard -> Dashboard Page

### Description:
This project is a basic frontend implementation of a login dashboard that includes specific functionality for username and password validation. Additionally, it redirects users to a dashboard page upon entering a specific password and provides a Forgot Password feature.

### Functionality:
The login dashboard implements the following functionalities:
1. **Username Validation:** The username field only accepts input in email format through JavaScript validation.

2. **Password Masking:** The password field is masked, ensuring the entered characters are hidden.

3. **Password Requirements:** Password validation restricts special characters to '@' only, requires at least one uppercase letter and one number.

4. **Redirect on Specific Password:** Entering the password 'SmartServTest@123' redirects users to a dashboard page.

5. **Forgot Password Functionality:** Clicking the 'Forgot your password' link opens an email client to send a password reset request to support@smartserv.io.

6. **Dashboard Page:** The dashboard page contains actual components like charts and dropdowns, as specified. No image is used.

### Implementation Details:
The project was developed using HTML, JavaScript, and potentially additional libraries for dashboard components. Key functionalities were implemented as follows:

1. **Username Validation:** JavaScript validation for the username field to accept email format only.

2. **Password Validation:** JavaScript validation enforcing password requirements.

3. **Redirect to Dashboard:** Conditional redirection to the dashboard page upon entering the specified password.

4. **Forgot Password Link:** Implementation of a link to trigger an email client for password reset.

5. **Dashboard Components:** Implementation of actual components like charts and dropdowns on the dashboard page.

### Deployment:
The login dashboard is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be accessed through the following link: [Zentrades Task 3-4](https://harshul14.github.io/Zentrades-Task-3-4/)
